### Python Pandas Introduction
+ Pandas is defined as an open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation in Python. The name of Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data, which means an Econometrics from Multidimensional data. It is used for data analysis in Python and developed by Wes McKinney in 2008.


+ Data analysis requires lots of processing, such as restructuring, cleaning or merging, etc. There are different tools are available for fast data processing, such as Numpy, Scipy, Cython, and Panda. But we prefer Pandas because working with Pandas is fast, simple and more expressive than other tools.

+ Pandas is built on top of the Numpy package, means Numpy is required for operating the Pandas.

+ Before Pandas, Python was capable for data preparation, but it only provided limited support for data analysis. So, Pandas came into the picture and enhanced the capabilities of data analysis. It can perform five significant steps required for processing and analysis of data irrespective of the origin of the data, i.e., load, manipulate, prepare, model, and analyze.
